## "I'm watching you, Wazowski. Always watching. Always." 
- Roz, Monsters, Inc.

This little app scratches an itch for us. It's hard to believe, but
some sites out there don't have RSS feeds, widgets, or easy ways
to find out when they are updated. This app allows you to watch
(or stalk) an URL, looking for a change in a specific area of the
page. It might be a change in price, an update to a version, or
the notification that an item is back in stock. It's whatever you
desire based on using xpath or css selectors. We check once an
hour or once a day.

There are no tests. We are hiring. Show us your
skills. Add some tests. Make some changes.
     
You'll need to set a username and github token as an environment variable or as a config/initializers/github.rb.      
For example my local config/initializers/github.rb is:

    Gist::GITHUB_LOGIN = 'foo'
    Gist::GITHUB_TOKEN = 'barbarbar'

Your github token can be found in your github account settings.
